   * Empties Claude's input box so the paste that follows is the whole of what Claude reads.
   *
   * The box is not reliably empty when a prompt arrives. Interrupting a turn puts the prompt it
   * interrupted back for editing, and a submit a cancel abandons between its paste and its Enter leaves
   * that paste behind; Paseo interrupts before it replaces a turn, so both are one message away in any
   * session the daemon is steering. What Claude then receives is the two run together as a single
   * prompt nobody wrote, sent from before the turn the interrupt rewound.
   *
   * Emptying it takes a key per line rather than one key. Ctrl-U kills the visual line the cursor is on,
   * so on residue Claude had wrapped it cuts at the wrap and leaves every line above -- which is not a
   * box that failed to clear but a box holding the front of the old message, the half a reader is least
   * likely to notice is not theirs. Measured against Claude Code v2.1.269 at this terminal size: a
   * 193-character prompt wraps after 115, and one Ctrl-U leaves exactly those 115 characters behind.
   *
   * Those keys go one write at a time. Written as one string they are not keys at all: Claude reads the
   * burst as pasted text and puts every one of the 40 control characters into the box, so the clear that
   * was meant to empty it is what fills it, and the prompt goes to Claude behind forty U+0015. See the
   * constants above for the evidence in Claude's own transcripts.
   *
   * The box is read back between keys, which is also what ends the run early -- an empty box is the
   * ordinary case and a key on one does nothing, so paying 40 keys for it would put a second on the front
   * of every prompt. The reading is not trusted on its own, because the screen is sampled and a paste too
   * recent to have been rendered is exactly the residue worth clearing: the run ends on a few empty
   * readings in a row, and a box that never reads empty gets the screenful the bound allows and no more.
   *
   * It also ends where the keys have stopped changing anything. Claude puts a suggested prompt in an
   * empty box as grey ghost text, which is not content and cannot be killed, but reads as content to
   * anything that scrapes the characters off a screen -- so a box showing one would otherwise take every
   * key of the bound, every time, and report itself uncleared afterwards. What is compared is the screen
   * from the box down rather than the box's own line, because Ctrl-U kills the last of the lines a long
   * prompt wrapped onto and leaves the first, which is the line the box is read from: on a wrapped
   * residue that line reads the same between keys while the box is visibly emptying.
