 * for itself lives in a directory Paseo owns and rewrites on every update, and the adapter there is
 * a native build behind a private path, so a host that builds the adapter somewhere of its own now
 * says where instead of being told its installation is unusable.
 *
 * So the checkout's own problem stops being fatal and becomes one reading among several. Nothing
 * here throws: every way this can fail is a sentence the panel shows, because the alternative is a
 * spawn failure whose stderr the ACP shim drops.
